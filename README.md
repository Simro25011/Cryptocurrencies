# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview

Martha is a Senior Manager in the Accountability Accounting Advisory Services team and is one of your key clients. Well-known investment bank Accountability Accounting is interested in offering its clients a new cryptocurrency portfolio. However, the company lost its way in the vast cryptocurrency space. So they asked us to create a report that included cryptocurrencies in the trading market and how they were grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we will be using  is not ideal, so it needs to be processed to fit the machine learning model. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning. To group cryptocurrencies, we will use a clustering algorithm. Our findings will be share with the board using data visualization.
